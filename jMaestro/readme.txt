This file contains everything and a lot of legacy code from initial testing and a lot of testing code

Note-able files include the BasicOpsTest which essentially was first the testing range, but now is in charge of everything.

The MIDINoteBar, MIDINoteExtractor and MIDIPane are all in charge of dealing with the display of the MIDI notes on to panels.

The Rest of the files are test files/ playgrounds for many different ideas.

The included midi files are for testing the imports.

The .sf2 files are sound fonts which can be used to change how the instruments sound.
